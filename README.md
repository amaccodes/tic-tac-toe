# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe

A fully functional Tic Tac Toe game built with **modular JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** as part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The game emphasizes clean code architecture using **factory functions** and the **module pattern (IIFE)** to avoid polluting the global namespace.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ 2-player game (custom names)
- ✅ Interactive 3x3 gameboard
- ✅ Win/draw detection logic
- ✅ UI updates via DOM interaction
- ✅ Restart functionality
- ✅ Modular, maintainable architecture

## 🔍 Design & Architecture

The project follows a **modular JavaScript** approach:

- **Gameboard Module**  
  Stores and renders the board (`array` structure)  
  Handles updates to cells

- **Player Factory Function**  
  Creates player objects with name and marker (`X` or `O`)

- **Game Controller Module**  
  Controls turn order, win checking, and game state

- **Display Controller Module**  
  Renders the board to the UI  
  Handles DOM events and user interactions

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Structure JavaScript code using factory functions and IIFEs
- Minimize global variables
- Plan logic into **modular, self-contained pieces**
- Use the **DOM API** for real-time UI updates
- Implement game state logic (turns, win/tie conditions)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure an application using **module patterns**
- How to separate **logic and presentation**
- How to build UI interactivity with **event listeners**
- Writing logic to detect **wins** and **draws**
- Dynamically updating the DOM based on state

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add **AI opponent** (minimax algorithm)
- Add animations or transitions
- Add difficulty levels
- Add sound effects
- Make the board responsive on mobile
